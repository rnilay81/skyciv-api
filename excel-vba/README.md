Open the SkyCiv_Excel_Template.xlsm file

There is an import and export sub routine that will enable easier development, you can use it or just manually import and export files, or just work in the Visual Basic Code Editor environment if you don't mind it. Some people don't :p. If you want to do this you will need to enable 'Trust access to the VBA project object model' in your Excel application. Beware, this may expose your system to threats if you are opening and running code that isn't from a trustworthy source (certainly not us ;).

If you want to make a custom ribbon you can download a useful tool for editing the customXML here https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor
